		<h1>Effects of the internet and electronic devices in or lives</h1>
		<h2>Devices</h2>
		<p>
		It is great that technology has innovated to the level that now, most people in Canada walk around carrying a computer in their pocket, which can be used to access the internet, play games, solve math equations, and as a flashlight. These devices are wonderful, they're light, easy to use, look nice, and provide easy access to the online world. These devces have their drawbacks, though. Since most of us carry around some kind of device that is linked to social media sites, it has become a habit for people to grab their phone and lean their head forward to see it. Some doctors refer to the results of this action as "text neck". Text neck is caused my bad posture, usually by staring at a phone repeatedly with your neck bent. This is not a natural position for the human body, so people who sit and stand with bad posture usually have neck pain and sometimes back pain aswell. Computers are another great tool, whether you're looking to play games, surf the web or create things, the computer is your go to device. Computers are amazing because we can interact with them more clearly than with mobile devices, as there is a physical mouse and keyboard. Computers have a lot of computational power, and are capable of performing advanced and complicated functions. Computers are another cause of the dreaded "text neck", mainly because they are used incorrectly. Sit back in the chair, with feet flat on the floor and a slight slouch. The monitior should be just under your line of sight. Practicing good posture helps maintain the neck, lower back and spine. If looked at for two long, devices can cause discomfort in the eyes, such as a burning sensation. Both computers and personal devices have many applicable uses to everyday life, and can be helpful in vastly many ways.

		<h2>The Worldwide Web</h2>
		<p>
		The internet is an extremely powerful tool accessed by most of the world, most of the time. The internet has completely changed the dynamic life all over the world. It is great becuase we have instant access to our social lives via social media, we can answer almost any question by looking it up, we can download programs and upload content to the internet. Without the internet, Facebook and Google wouldn't exsist. It's hard to fathom because both those companies are household names - "Just Google it" and "Post it to Facebook" are common phrases. The internet can also be used for illegal activity, which is a massive downside because of malware and other illegal content floating around on the web. Luckily, there are powerful applications that filter out this malicious material and protect personal devices from attack. The internet is useful for communication with friends, however, it poses issues with face to face interaction. For example, instead of starting a conversation with someone, one may simply pull out their phone and start texting. This is bad becuase we're made to communicate in person, and the internet paired with personal devices are ruining our social capabilities. All in all, the internet is extremely useful and is very valuable.
